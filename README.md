## Preconditions:

- Python 3

## Running the App locally
If you wish to download the project, follow these instructions.

### Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/marciovrl/fastapi-example.git
```
After you clone the project, cd into the Listify directory.

### Virtual environmnet with venv
You can create a virtual environment in a directory using Python's venv module:

```
python -m venv env
```
That will create a directory ./env/ with the Python binaries and then you will be able to install packages for that isolated environment.

### Activate the environment
Activate the new environment with:

For Linux, macOS
```
source ./env/bin/activate
```

For Windows PowerShell
```
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If it shows the pip binary at env/bin/pip then it worked. ðŸŽ‰
Make sure you have the latest pip version on your virtual environment to avoid errors on the next steps:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run server
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Run test
```
pytest app/test.py
```
